To add the intents and train your bot faster you can add a file in the format of json and call it <strong>phrases.json</strong>. The structure of your json file must be following:

```json
{
  "name_of_intent": {
    "questions": [],
    "answer": ""
  },
  "name_of_intent": {
    "questions": [],
    "answer": ""
  }
}
```

```bash
python download_phrases.py
